<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>
   We started this company as a group of friends playing sports together. I common problem that we had growing up in countryside Ireland was
   the rising prices of football equiment such as Jerseys and the cheap quality other sellers were using to reduce cost of production yet
   not lowering the price of their products. So we came together to start a business for making affordable Jerseys for people and making them
   with high quality materials so that they can last everyday wear and tear that occurs whilst playing sports.
</p>
<p>
   A big focus of ours was to produce high quality Jerseys without cutting corners or using methods of production that would damage the enviornment.
   With the dumping of plastics and excessive use of burning fossil fuels, our climate and the world around us continues to suffer. Our aim is to try and
   help the enviornment for the future generations. A very important part of our business was playing sports and the way this business idea came about was
   by playing sports together as children. We want to try and help reduce worsenung enviornmental impact the we have by producing Jerseys by using the polyester
   from dumped plastics such as plastic bottles and other plastic products commonly thrown away. The aim is the more we can help the envionrnment now then
   it will allow future generation to also play and love sports as much as we did when we were children.
</p>
<p>
  Another big aspect that we try and focus on is giving back to the communities that help support our business by purchasing our Jerseys and positive word of
  mouth, but more importantly show the next generations the fantastic sport that is Gaelic football and encourage them to try and get involved. It is a fantastic
  sport for young people as it helps them to socialise and meet new people, working together as a team, keep fit and so much more. Our aim is to help the Gaelic football
  and Hurling clubs across the country by providing them with Jerseys and sports equipment for under age football teams. We found our love for the sport from playing
  under age football and still kept the love of the sport and playing to this day. We want to give back and help the next generations see the fantastic sport that we
  see it as.
</p>
<p>
  We want to make a high quality and affordable football Jerseys for anyone in the world. We ship world wide. Shipping in Ireland should arrive to your door within 3
  business days. Dependent on the country of living the delivery may take up to 2 weeks if orderd from outside of Ireland.
